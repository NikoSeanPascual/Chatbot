RELEARNING PYTHON

11/10/25 (DAY 1)

THE MOST BASIC:
Variable - Stores information
print() - prints out what is put inside the parenthesis even if its strings, intergers and floats
len() - counts how long a text and other types
#text here# - comment in a code, the code ignores this as its used to organize the code
LEN RULES
[0] - prints the first letter in the variable your referring to
[0:3] - prints the first 3 letters in the variable your referring to
TYPES:
strings - basically texts and when multiplying it prints it multiple times not like numbers
integers - whole numbers, you can multiply subtract and etc
float - numbers with decimals where like integer you can multiply subtract and etc
booleans - True or False
STRINGS RULES
\ - helps with confusion in codes for example print("hello \"world") if we want to add the one parenthesis inside the string we have to add this symbol
\n - basically it cuts the string wherever you put it and put the rest in the next line for example print("hello \nworld") this code would print hello in the first line in the console and print world in the second line
f"" - formatted strings can help print multiple types at once for example print(f"{ex_1} {ex_2}") it will print two of this variables. it can also do integers and other types
NUMBERS RULES AND FUNCTIONS
round() - rounds a decimal number to where its closest to, for example 2.9 would be rounded up to 3 because its closest to the number 3 but if its 2.4 it will stay the same as 2
abs() - basically means ABSOLUTE which returns the absolute of the number where, when a number of negative it will turn them to positive
EXPRESSIONS
+ - additions
- - subtraction
* - multiplication
/ - division
// - basically print out a whole number of a division, theres no decimals
% - prints out the remainder of the division
** - exponent, raised to the power of

FUNCTION = METHODS
.upper() - uppercase every thing in a string or text, for example print(ex_1.upper()) where it will basically change the string words to upper case keep in mind it only works in strings, it will return an attribute error if you try to upper an integers
.lower() - the opposite of upper instead it turns the string to lowercase letters
.title() - it will turn the first letter of a word to an uppercase letter
.strip() - removes the white space at the beginning of the text
.rstrip() - the same function as .strip() but instead it removes the whitespace at the end of the line
.find() - finds the index or in the long version means it will count how many letters it is till you get to the word in the parenthesis keep in mind the word has to be exact as an uppercase is different from a lowercase in the mind of a computer
.replace() - straight forward enough, it just replace the letters you put inside the parenthesis and change the letter that it finds to a specific letter that you put, for example; print(ex_1.replace("a", "o")) it will replace every "a" in the ex_1 variable to "o"
in - basically checks if the letter you put before it is in the variable you put beside it via boolean(True or False), for example; print("Niko" in ex_1) it will look for the word Niko in the variable and if it finds one it will print True and if it doesnt it prints False
not in - basically the same as in but instead of checking if there is one it will check if there no specific word in that variable, for example; print("Niko" not in ex_1) so if it didnt find any it will print out True and if it found one its False

11/11/25 (DAY 2)
Practiced making simple project like:
* Word-breakdown-app

math - is a built in module that can help us make complex mathematical functions
input() - let us type
int() - let us transform strings to integers or float to integers
float() - let us transform strings to float or integers to float
bool() - basically sees everything that has NONE a false and if there is something inside the string it will return a True, this also works in integers and float if the number is larger or smaller than 0 its a true but if it 0 its a false
> - greater than will check if the number or string on the left is larger than the right
< - less than will check if the number or string of the left is smaller than the right
>= - greater than or equal to, checks if the number or strings on the left is larger than the right or if its equal
<= - less than or equal to, checks if the number or strings on the left is smaller than the right or if its equal
!= - checks if the number or strings is different
CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
if - let us make conditions
elif - we usually use this whenever we want to make multiple conditions
else - if none of the conditions work this will be the only one to be printed out

11/12/25 (DAY 3)
Practiced making simple project like:
* Simple Quiz Game
* Minecraft-scuff edition

for - use to make loops or print the same thing over and over again
range() - where we put how many times, something will run  in a loop you can put how long you wanted it to be inside the loop (3), (1, 4)
number - a built in int variable usually use to track and count how many times tou will run a loop
iterable - something you can loop through
uniterable - something you can't loop through
mutable - you can change it after creating it
immutable - you cant change it after creating it
while - is a type of loop like the for loop with the only difference of that for loops, loop a specific numbe of times depending on what you put in the range() meanwhile a while loop continues to loop till the condition becomes False
def - a function, doesnt take any input like print()
return - as the same suggest it returns a function inside back

11/13/25 (DAY 4)
Practiced making simple project like:
* Simple-calculator(with 8 other operations)
* an advanced chatbot

tuple - you cant change whatever you put inside, a tuple is a parethesis (), immutable and works almost like a list, for example (2.5, 1.5, 3.3)
list - you can change, add, remove anything you put inside, a tuple is a square bracket [], and can store multiple data, for example ["Niko", "Maureen", "Aron"]
set - cannot contain duplicate, a dictionary is a curly bracket {} for example, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
dictionary - we can add multiple datas with there own value like {'bob': 1, 'James': 2}

11/14/25 (DAY 5)
Practiced making projects like:
* Grade analyzer
* to-do-list

.items() - basically used dictionaries to return a view object that a list of the dictionary's key-value pairs as tuples, This method is particularly useful for iterating over the dictionary's content.
max() - basically prints out the largest thing in terms of value inside a dictionary, useful for making projects such as grade analyzer
min() - the opposite of max, it prints out he smallest value inside dictionary, useful for making projects like grade analyzer
enumerate() - its used to iterate over an iterable, it returns an enumerate object, which can be converted into a list of tuples or used directly in a loop

11/15/25 (DAY 6)
(MEGA RECALL)
* Text cleanup tool (5 minutes)
* Temperature converter (10 minutes to make)
* BMI Calculator (40 minutes to make)
* username checker
* Age Classifier

11/16/25 (DAY 7)
* Simple log-in system
* ALL IN ONE unit converter
* Letter counter
* Hidden word game
* Typing speed Tester

11/17/25 (DAY 8)
*LEARNED HOW TO USE TERMINAl
TERMINAL RUNS
ls - gives the total
 python learning.py - basically runs the learning.py in the terminal
 pwd - basically tells you what path you are in
 cd .\November-projects\ - basically tells the terminal to go into the folder named .\November-projects\ inside the current folder (. means "current folder")

pseudocode - a step-by-step textual representation of an algoritihm that uses plain english and programming-like structures to describe the logic of a solution. example (if, elif, else while, for)

11/18/25 (DAY 9)
*WORKED IN A HARD PROJECT AND ITS STILL NOT DONE
NIKOS OS - has a log in system that is fool proof, after logging in you can choose multiple apps by typing out the number, currently there are 4 turning complete apps like unit convertion
           letter counter, hidden word game with a nice loop and actual rules and typing test +

11/19/25 (DAY 10)
* WORST DAY EVER - FIXED A : A LOT OF CODES
* GIT - GITHUB SCREWED ME, BUGS EVERYWHERE MY LOCAL FILE IS CONNECTED TOEVERYTHING SO WHEN I ADD A NEW REPO IT WENT TO THE GRADE ANALYZER

11/20/25 (DAY 11)
* BUG FIXES - fixed some annoying bugs in my mini-os project
* MORE BUG FIXES - fixed GIT, i can now easily send project in github

* __name__ - controls what runs automatically when you import file
* assert - is like a checkpoint or safety check
* eval() - takes strings and runs it as python code, then give us the result. for example eval("2 + 3") -> 5

11/21/25 (DAY 12)
__init__.py - basically tells python that this folder is special and should be treated like a package
.append() - basically it can add stuff in a list, but keep in mind it only works in list...it doesnt work in a set nor dictionaries and tuples
open() - lets you open files that you can use in your code
write() - does stuff in the file
close() - basically closes the file so nothing leaks or gets lost
with - basically automatically closes the file you open
sorted() - takes a list and gives you a new list in order from smallest to largest
